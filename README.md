1.1.6 CSE Project

Our app is a simple notepad app where users can use their account to write text-based notes in a simplistic interface. The app includes a single text box where users can type in their notes, and the notes will save. The meaning behind this app is to provide people with a simplistic note-taking app with no fancy features but with just quick jots of notes. It ties into extracurricular activities because many of these activities need notes on the spot in order to succeed.
